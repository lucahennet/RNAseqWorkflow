# Differential expression analysis from bulk RNA-seq data
This project aims to determine the effect of toxoplasma infection on gene expression in mouse blood and lung. The goal is to produce lists of genes that are differentially expressed between two experimental groups, and identify gene ontology (GO) terms enriched for DE genes.

The dataset includes 3â€“5 biological replicates from two distinct mouse tissues, encompassing both Toxoplasma-infected and uninfected control samples, derived from the study by Singhania et al., 2019. Libraries were prepared using a strand-specific protocol and sequenced in high-resolution paired-end mode with Illumina HiSeq 4000.
